# Bike Bandits

Bike Bandits is a Service Management App for use by a bike shop. It's main features are focused around managing service tickets from creation to work completion.

More of what why and how

This app is a prototype for more complete iterations. It contains the fundamental features for a ticket management app, but will need to be reworked before it would be ready for a business application. In this version I focused on developing the database management that will be the foundation of the app. I focused on keeping the page simple and easy to navigate even for a first time user. Everything is clearly labeled an user friendly.

Future versions will include features such as:
- Connecting to a bicycle parts catalogue
- Secure User Accounts
    - technician accounts for ticket management
    - customer accounts for viewing ticket status and shopping
- Payments system
- Flush out and refine existing features
